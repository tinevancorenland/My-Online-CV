**My online resume**

[Find it here](https://tinevancorenland.github.io/My-Online-CV/)

I made this online resume using bootstrap and scss, to get more familiar with them. I had an example image in mind on which I based my layout (which I added in the Assets folder) and I used html with some bootstrap classes, and scss with some variables en nested syntax to create my own version of it.
